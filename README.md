Vue of up to 16 bits
====================

Little demo that shows the interaction between a text input field and
checkboxes using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) framework.

Vue.js is not part of the source code and must be downloaded first.
There is a `bower.json` file to solve that problem.
If you have [Bower](https://bower.io) installed you may run
`bower install` to get Vue.js. After that you can open the file
`vue-bits.html` with your browser and play with some bits. :-)
